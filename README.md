# What is this?
A project to learn Java core.    
I had been looking for ideas projects to practice Java and found this intern task on the internet.  
I liked the ticket because it involves the usage of the main java core functionalities such as:
- Interaction with filesystem
- IO operations
- Multithreading
- Date and time API
- etc

I tried to avoid any over-engineering but at the same time added some good practices like dependency injection and unit test the main business logic.
## What is the task description?
The task description could be found in Intern Developer Task -2016.docx file.
